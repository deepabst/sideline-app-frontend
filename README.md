### Description
This app aspires to be loaded on every phone at Saturday morning sport matches. Spectating parents, coaches or friends can track thier favourite teams or players stats while chatting online with other stat gatherers or those who couldn't make it to the game.

### Background

Software Engineer Immersive course group project 2 - built during week 9 of 12 at General Assembly Sydney. After 1 week of exposure to React and 8 weeks total coding experience.
Our task- build a full web app from front to back.
A project full of firsts! This was our first go at version control in a team setting, managing git branches and merge conflicts on the fly. Our first time attempting realtime data transfer via websockets. It was also a first time getting a login to work from a react front end to a rails backend.

### Main features
Login/logout - React FrontEnd to Rails Backend using knock and jwt
Teams Players Stats - Create Read Update and Delete
